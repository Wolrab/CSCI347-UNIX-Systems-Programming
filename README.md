#Course Description

Modern software is a coordinated effort between the application logic stored in the
program and services provided by the operating system. This course focuses on how
a program uses the OS services. Topics include virtual memory, dynamic memory,
System I/O, process management, and concurrency concepts including interprocess
and multi-threaded programming.

**Prerequisites:** CSCI 247.

# Communication

I am committed to establishing and maintaining a classroom climate that is
inclusive and respectful for all students. Learning includes being able to voice
a variety of perspectives, and classroom discussion is encouraged. While
expressed ideas may vary or be opposed to one another, it is important for all
of us to listen and engage respectfully with each other.

We will use Canvas to post some assignments and grades, but please **do not** use
Canvas conversations. I will not check Canvas for communication. Email is much
faster and is preferred.
